Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance. I ain't mad, I just think it's messed up you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert you didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours, and you just said no.
