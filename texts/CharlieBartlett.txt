My name is Charlie Bartlett. If there's one thing I want you guys to walk away with tonight, it's that you guys don't need me. I really mean it. You think I'm any less screwed up than you are? I get up every morning and I look in the mirror and I try and figure out just where I fit in and I draw a complete blank.
