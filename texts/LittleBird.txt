Little bird, tell me, where do you go to get those colors of blue and gold, where do you find such beautiful clothes? Oh, little bird, tell me, where do you go? Are you up there in the silver clouds, or hopping here and there down on the ground? Are you gazing at the stars as you weave your yarn? Little bird, how do you do dressed so fine in gold and blue? Those feathers look delightful on you, I can't tell if they're old or new.
