Final lap, I'm on top of the world, and I will never rest for a second again! One more time I have beaten them out. The scent of gasoline announces the end. They all said I'd best give it up. What a fool to believe their lies. Now they've fallen, I'm at the top. Are you ready now to die? I came up from the bottom and into the top. For the first time I feel alive. I can fly like an eagle and strike like a hawk. Do you think you can survive... the top?
