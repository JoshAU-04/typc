As the red day is dawning and the lightning cracks the sky, they'll raise their hands to the heavens above with resentment to their eyes. Running back from the mid-morning light, there's a burning in my heart. We're banished from a time in a fallen land to a life beyond the stars. In your darkest dreams see to believe our destiny is time. And endlessly we'll all be free tonight.
