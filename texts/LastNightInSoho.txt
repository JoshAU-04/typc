Don't hang around and let your problems surround you, there are movie shows... downtown. Maybe you know some little places to go to where they never close... downtown. Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova, you'll be dancing with 'em too before the night is over, happy again, the lights are much brighter there, you can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares so go downtown. Where all the lights are bright, downtown. Waiting for you tonight, downtown. You're gonna be alright now, downtown.
