This is me! Up to now, you still don't even see me for who I really am! I'm you, Dad. I tried to give you one last chance, like you said with Breeze, but you're in the way. You're in the way of my future, like you said he was in the way of yours. Ain't that what you said? In the way of your future right? Put the gun down. Tariq, if you do this, you can never go back. I'll do anything to go back, to go back to how it was before you left us for Angela. I just can't, it's too late.
