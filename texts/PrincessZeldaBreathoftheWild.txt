Ganon was born out of a dark past. He is a pure embodiment of the ancient evil that is reborn time and time again... He has given up on reincarnation and assumed his pure, enraged form. If set free upon our world, the destruction will be unlike anything ever seen before. I entrust you with the Bow of Light - a powerful weapon in the face of evil. Link... you may not yet be at a point where you have fully recovered your power or all of your memories... But courage need not be remembered... for it is never forgotten.
