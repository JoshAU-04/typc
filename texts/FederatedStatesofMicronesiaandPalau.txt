Renting a car in Palau has its advantages and disadvantages. Taxis and tour companies can take you on guided tours of the big island, but they are often expensive and less convenient than a rental car. Having your own car will allow you to go off the beaten path and to take your time. It is also a great idea if you are planning to spend a night or two at one of the little beach resorts up north.
