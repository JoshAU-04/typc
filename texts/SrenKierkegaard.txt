Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. We do not remember days, we remember moments. Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving. Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened. In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
