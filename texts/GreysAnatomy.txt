The last 30 days have taught me so much. And all I wanted when we first came here was to know that we would leave together. But from the minute I sat down, I could feel it. I felt like I was going to be suffocated. The last several weeks, I have laughed more, I have done more, I have enjoyed myself more. And I finally feel free. And by being free, I can see now that constantly trying to fix us is the thing that's been killing me slowly. And I don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to fix it or fix us anymore. Maybe instead of loving you so hard, I should be myself for a while. I should love me, and you should love you, and together we love Sofia, rather than... I want so much for you, Arizona. So much more than this. More than being stuck with someone who feels stuck. I want you to feel free too.
