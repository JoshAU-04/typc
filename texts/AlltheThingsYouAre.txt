You are the promised kiss of springtime that makes the lonely winter seem long. You are the breathless hush of evening that trembles on the brink of a lovely song. You are the angel glow that lights a star, the dearest things I know are what you are. Some day my happy arms will hold you, and some day I'll know that moment divine when all the things you are, are mine.
