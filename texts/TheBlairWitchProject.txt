I just want to apologize to Mike's mom and Josh's mom and my mom. And I'm sorry to everyone. I was very naive. I am so, so sorry for everything that has happened. Because in spite of what Mike says now, it is my fault. Because it was my project and I insisted. I insisted on everything. I insisted we weren't lost. I insisted we keep going. I insisted that we walk south. Everything had to be my way and this is where we've ended up. And it's all because of me that we're here now: hungry and cold and hunted. I love you, Mom and Dad. I am so sorry... what is that? I'm scared to close my eyes and I'm scared to open them. I'm going to die out here.
