These people who stand against me may be innocent humans, but I will kill them. I'm ready to strike them down without a moment's hesitation, or the slightest hint of regret! I can do this for you. I'm a monster and I will do what needs to be done. But what will you do, Sir Integra? My guns are prepared for battle, my sights are trained, my magazine is fully loaded, I've pulled the slide and removed the safety, everything is ready and waiting! Still, you must be the one to pull the trigger. So what will you do? I'm waiting for orders, my master.
