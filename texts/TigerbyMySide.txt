Seen about a million roads. I've done the bong to Tokyo. I've been a clone and had a little luck. Swam across the golden sea a certain price of levity. It brings us up and only makes us sleep. Television changing channels telling people wearing flannels. Culture shocking walkways to the shore. Even though I never know and even though I never know. And even though I never want to know.
