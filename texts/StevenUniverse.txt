The truth is... I think that we should stay, and if - and if the time comes, if the Diamonds do come to wipe this planet off the star maps, I think we should fight for this life we've built instead of tearing it up out of the ground! I think we can win. I think you can win. Earth is our home now. Isn't it worth fighting for?
