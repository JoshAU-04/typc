This time tomorrow, where will we be? On a spaceship somewhere sailing across an empty sea? This time tomorrow, what will we know? Will we still be here watching an in-flight movie show? I'll leave the sun behind me and I'll watch the clouds as they sadly pass me by seven miles below me. I can see the world and it ain't so big at all.
