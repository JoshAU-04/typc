We all have a purpose. We have a place we're supposed to fit. I fit mine... so you can fit yours. I know. I know you don't want me to do this, but it's what I'm supposed to do. I know it won't seem like it, but I will be okay. It's the only way that everything will work. It's the only way that everything will be okay. You're going to make it okay. I promise. This is how I help you make it all okay. One last thing. It's important that you never ever EVER forget this. I love you.
