Goodbye to you my trusted friend, we've known each other since we were nine or ten. Together we've climbed hills and trees, learned of love and ABCs. Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees. Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die when all the birds are singing in the sky. Now that spring is in the air, pretty girls are everywhere. Think of me and I'll be there.
