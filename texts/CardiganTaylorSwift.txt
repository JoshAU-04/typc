I knew you'd linger like a tattoo-kiss. I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs. The smell of smoke would hang around this long 'cause I knew everything when I was young. I knew I'd curse you for the longest time, chasing shadows in the grocery line. I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired, and you'd be standing in my front porch light and I knew you'd come back to me.
