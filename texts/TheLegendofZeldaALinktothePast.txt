I sense that a mighty evil force guides the wizard's actions and augments his magical power. The only weapon potent enough to defeat the wizard is the legendary Master Sword. It is said that the village elder is a descendant of one of the seven wise men. Maybe he can tell you more. I will mark his house on your map. But watch your every move! I am certain that the castle soldiers will be looking for you now! I will hide Princess Zelda here. Do not worry! Seek the elder!
