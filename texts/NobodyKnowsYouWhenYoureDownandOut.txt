Once I lived the life of a millionaire, spending my money, I didn't care. I carried my friends out for a good time buying bootleg liquor, champagne, and wine. Then I began to fall so low, I didn't have a friend, and no place to go. So if I ever get my hand on a dollar again I'm gonna hold on to it till them eagles grin. Nobody knows you when you're down and out. In my pocket, not one penny, and my friends I haven't any. But if I ever get on my feet again, then I'll meet my long lost friend. It's mighty strange, without a doubt, nobody knows you when you're down and out.
