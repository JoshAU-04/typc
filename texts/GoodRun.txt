I think a lot about the way it ends - the kind of things no one ever wants me to say again. But the line's in my mind so when I peace I'll know I had the best times, with the greatest friends. That's why I own it, live in the moment, trying to make the most of it, notice the unnoticed. And any stacks that I stack, well that's a bonus, I've seen too many dull folks working the wrong motives. So while you're napping in the afternoon, I'm in the classroom raising up my hand, yes I'm that dude. I'm in the Cancun sands, just passing through till I'm in the studio booth tracking these raps too. And if you're waiting for anybody to ask you where your passion falls or what you have to do, then consider this your call to be all you can be. Stand up tall, hustle, no plan B.
