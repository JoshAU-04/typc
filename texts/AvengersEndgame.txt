Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning, and that'll be it. And Pep, I know I said no more surprises, but I got to say I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like, well, you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean actually if you grieve for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. I'm going to rest my eyes. Please know when I drift off, it'll be like every night. I'm fine, totally fine. I'll dream about you, because it's always you.
