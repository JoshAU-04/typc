When the little bluebird, who has never said a word, starts to sing, "Spring, spring." When the little bluebell, at the bottom of the dell, starts to ring, ding ding. When the little blue clerk, in the middle of his work, starts a tune to the moon up above. It is nature, that's all, simply telling us to fall in love.
