Whoever you may be, governor, prince or anyone else, whom the gods may choose to exercise kingship, I have made you a tablet-box and written a stone tablet. I have deposited them for you in Cutha, in the cella of Nergal in the temple E-meslam. Behold this stone tablet, give ear to what this stone tablet says!
