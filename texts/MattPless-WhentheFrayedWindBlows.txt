If it starts with an explosion do you end it with a bang? First the whistles start a-blowin' then the guilty finally hang. There's a storm on the horizon and the waters on the rise, we're watching history repeatin' with the changin' times. The figureheads keep talking but they're buried in the sand. Everyone is pointing fingers, everybody plays their hand. The fix is in, the game is rigged, the pawns are polarized. You either pick a side or think outside the picket lines.
