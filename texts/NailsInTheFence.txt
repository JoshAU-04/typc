There was a little boy who had a very bad temper. His father decided to give him a bag of nails and told him that every time he got upset, he had to drive a nail into the fence around his house. On the first day, the boy drove 37 nails into that fence. The boy gradually began to control his temper over the next several weeks, and the number of nails he was hammering into the fence slowly decreased. He found it easier to control his temper than to drive those nails into the fence. Finally, the day came when the boy did not bother. He told his father the news and the father suggested that the boy should now pull out a nail every day to keep his temper in check. Days passed and the boy was finally able to tell his father "I finished pulling the nails out of the fence." The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. "You have done well, my son, but look at the holes. The fence will never be the same. When you say things when you are angry, they leave a scar like this. No matter how many times you ask for forgiveness, since the wound is there."
