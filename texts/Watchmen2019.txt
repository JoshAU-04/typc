I am neither, sire, and I assure you that my activities are purely recreational in nature. Furthermore, I would never imagine to transgress the terms upon which we agreed. I am available, at your leisure and by your grace, to discuss this matter further should you wish to repeat your ridiculous accusations in person. That said, I'm pleased you enjoyed the tomatoes. All the best wishes and encouragement. Adrian Veidt.
