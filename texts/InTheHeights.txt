There's a breeze off the Hudson, and just when you think you're sick of living here, the memory floods in, the morning light off the fire escapes, the nights at Bennett Park blasting Big Pun tapes, I'm gonna miss this place to tell you the truth, Kevin dispensing wisdom from his dispatch booth and at dawn, Vanessa at the salon, we gotta move on... but who's gonna notice we're gone? When our job's done as the evening winds down to a crawl, son, can I ease my mind when we're all done? When we've resigned in the long run, what do we leave behind? Most of all, I'll miss Abuela's whispers, doing the Lotto Pick Six every Christmas... in five years, when this whole city's rich folks and hipsters, who's gonna miss this raggedy little business?
