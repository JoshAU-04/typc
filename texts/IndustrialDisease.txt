Warning lights are flashing down at Quality Control. Somebody threw a spanner and they threw him in the hole. There's rumors in the loading bay and anger in the town. Somebody blew the whistle and the walls came down. There's a meeting in the boardroom. They're trying to trace the smell. There's leaking in the washroom, there's a sneak in personnel. Somewhere in the corridors someone was heard to sneeze. Goodness me, could this be Industrial Disease?
