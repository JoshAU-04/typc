It was lunch time and Mother decided we were going to have a picnic right there on the attic floor. I remember helping her spread the rug, laying out plates of sandwiches cut into triangles, slices of sweet yellow mango, cartons of juice, crackers. There was coffee in a flask for Mother and warm creamy chocolate for me in a beaker.
