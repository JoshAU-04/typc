After the victory at Wounded Knee, the angel of Columbia did present herself to Father Comstock and show him a vision of the future. And so our Prophet led the people away from the Sodom Below, up, up into the city, where they created an even more perfect union. But it was the miracle child, the lamb, that is the future of our city. For the Prophet has said that she in the tower will lead the Sodom Below into righteousness.
