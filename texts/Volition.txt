It's freeing to know, it's all up to me, who I choose to be, what I choose to leave. This miracle that we get to witness, this pause in the chaos, it's Love. This speck in a galaxy, dot in a sunbeam, it's more than enough. You gotta realize your worth, you're meant to be on this earth. Think about how many miracles lead to your birth. Don't put a lock on your mind, life is yet to be defined. Beauty in the unknown, for a human this is home.
