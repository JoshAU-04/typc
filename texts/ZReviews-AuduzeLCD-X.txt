I'm gonna tell you a story. You go to a party and you walk up to the guys and you're like, "I just bought a two thousand dollar big screen TV, and surround sound." Or you walk up to the wife and you're like, "What do you think of my new fifteen hundred dollar earrings I bought for you." And nobody bats an eye. But you mention once that you're thinking about spending seventeen hundred dollars on a set of headphones, and everybody loses their mind! And I don't understand why.
