I know you feel where I'm coming from, regardless of the things in my past that I've done. Most of it really was for the hell of the fun, on the carousel so around I spun. With no directions just tryna get some. Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun. And so I lost more than I had ever won, and honestly, I ended up with none.
