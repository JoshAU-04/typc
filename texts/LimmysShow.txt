The number nine is not ten. The number eleven is not ten. Although the two numbers are almost ten, they can never be ten. They are untenable. You can add one to nine to make it ten, but it would no longer be nine! It would be ten! Same with eleven! When nine is nine and eleven is eleven, they are untenable! Their possessions are untenable! They have to go.
