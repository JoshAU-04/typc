Where there's a will, there's a way - kinda beautiful. And every night has its day - so magical. And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle that can't be defeated. For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable; in every lost soul the bones of a miracle; for every dreamer a dream - we're unstoppable with something to believe in.
