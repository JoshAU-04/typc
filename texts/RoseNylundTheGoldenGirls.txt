No, Blanche. I'm not going to let you do that. I've been doing a lot of thinking. If, after all the years of love and companionship, Fernando and I are meant to part company, I'll just have to accept that. Time to time, life deals you an unfriendly hand; there's nothing you can do about it. I guess there's a lesson to be learned here. Sometimes life just isn't fair, kiddo.
