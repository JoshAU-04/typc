I'm taking over my body. Back in control, no more shotty. I bet a lot of me was lost, T's uncrossed and I's undotted. I fought it a lot. And it seems a lot like flesh is all I got. Not anymore, flesh out the door. Swat. I must've forgot, you can't trust me. I'm open a moment and close when you show it. Before you know it, I'm lost at sea. And now that I write and think about it. And the story unfolds.
