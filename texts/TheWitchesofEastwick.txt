Well... you clean up the dirt, there's just more dirt to clean up tomorrow. Make the beds, they just have to be made tomorrow. Wash the dishes, more to wash tomorrow. Make dinner, it just gets eaten, doesn't it? The world keeps growing, and you feed it. But it doesn't feed you, does it? But... how much can you take? How much can you take before you snap?
