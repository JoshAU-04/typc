When you don't know that you're wrong, or just how wrong you are. My feet are always heavy, as I inch toward the door. I thought we'd leave us for ourselves, a hundred times before, but I guess we're always leaving, even when we look the same. And it eases me somehow to know that even this will change. If you've got some light in you, then go before it's gone - burn your fire for no witness, it's the only way it's done.
