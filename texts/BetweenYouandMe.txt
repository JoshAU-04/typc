Sorrow is a lonely feeling. Unsettled is a painful place. I've lived with both for far too long now since we've parted ways. I've been wrestling with my conscience, and I've found myself to blame. If there's to be any resolution, I've got to peel this pride away. Just between you and me, I've got something to say, wanna get it straight, before the sun goes down. Just between you and me, confession needs to be made, recompense is my way to freedom now.
