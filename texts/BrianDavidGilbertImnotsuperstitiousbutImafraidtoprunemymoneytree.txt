I'm not superstitious but I am afraid to prune my money tree. It's just that it's the only plant I've ever had that's seemed to actually grow healthily. And though I know wealth is not affected by a plant on my shelf, if I take my chances and my finances coincidentally fail while my money tree dies right before my eyes then my mind will think those things coincided causally. But my tree needs pruning or else it'll grow too wild and if I do it right then I could propagate it, so why've I waited to prune this tree?
