When was the last time you remember doing something during the day? And I'm not talking about some distant, half-forgotten childhood memory, I mean like yesterday? Last week? When? Can you come up with a single memory? You can't, can you? You know something, I don't think the sun even exists in this place. 'Cause I've been up for hours and hours and hours, and the night never ends here.
