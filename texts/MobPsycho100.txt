Listen. Just because you have psychic powers, it doesn't make you any less human. It's the same as people who are fast, people who are book smart, and people with strong body odor. Psychic powers are just another characteristic. You must embrace that as a part of yourself and continue to live positively. The truth behind one's charm is kindness. Become a good person. That is all.
