Imagine if you got what you want every time. No struggle, no hard work, no challenges, no hard work required. Some of you saying that would be great. You would be weak and then when something hard comes up in your life you wouldn't know how to handle it because you have never gone through anything that strengthens you. You cannot grow without struggle, you cannot develop strength without resistance, without challenging yourself, without struggle. Pain is your friend, maybe not in the moment, but for the evolution of your soul, for the long term benefit of you, as a stronger human being.
