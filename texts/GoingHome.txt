Going home, going home, I'm just going home. Quiet-like, some still day, I'm just going home. It's not far, just close by, through an open door. Work all done, cares laid by, going to roam no more. Mother's there expecting me, father's waiting, too. Lots of folks gathered there, all the friends I knew.
