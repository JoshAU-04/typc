Myanmar and Brazil. Amusing coincidence that two of the three countries that provide the world's sesame seeds have such large cicada population, no? The cicadas of Myanmar emerge every 13 years, while the Brazilian cicadas emerge every 17. Next year they will hatch, simultaneously, for the first time in 221 years. Crops from both countries will be decimated. Unlike Myanmar and Brazil, Indonesia has no cicada population. I was surprised to see Indonesian sesame seed futures priced so low. I made a purchase. And now, if the shortage spikes the global price even ten percent. We'll profit... Evan? "Sixty-eight million dollars." If you wish, I could tap that projected revenue and make you a bridge loan of 15 million dollars, gentlemen.
