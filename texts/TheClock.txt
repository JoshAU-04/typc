Joe, darling, you're coming back. Do you want me to tell you how I know? Two days ago you came to this city and you didn't know anyone. You didn't know me and I didn't know you, and now we're married. And we both know that that was meant to be. So don't you see? Whoever makes the arrangements for people is doing pretty well for us. That's all we need to know.
