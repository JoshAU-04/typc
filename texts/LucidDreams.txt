I still see your shadows in my room, can't take back the love that I gave you. It's to the point where I love and I hate you, and I cannot change you so I must replace you. Easier said than done, I thought you were the one. Listening to my heart, instead of my head. You found another one, but I am the better one. I won't let you forget me.
