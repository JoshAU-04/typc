Don't get me wrong, I love who I am. I don't wanna be ungrateful, it probably sounds strange. I really love the role I play, the songs I sing. But with all the fame, the things that seem so simple are suddenly so far out of reach. I wish that they could see that underneath I'm just an ordinary girl! Sometimes I'm lazy, I get bored. I get scared, I feel ignored. I feel happy, I get silly. I choke on my own words. I make wishes, I have dreams. And I still want to believe anything can happen in this world for an ordinary girl.
