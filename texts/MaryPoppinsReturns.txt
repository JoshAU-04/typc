Once upon a time in a nursery rhyme, there was a castle with a king hiding in a wing because he never went to school to learn a single thing, he had scepters and swords and a parliament of lords, but on the inside, he was sad, egad! Because he never had a wisdom for numbers, a wisdom for words, though his crown was quite immense, his brain was smaller than a bird's, so the queen of the nation made a royal proclamation: "To the Missus and the Messieurs, the more or lessers, bring me all the land's professors!" and then she went to the hairdressers and they came from the east and they came from the south, from each college they poured knowledge from their brains into his mouth, but the king couldn't learn so each professor met their fate for the queen had their heads removed and placed upon the gate and on that date, I state their wives all got a note, their mate was now the late-great. But then suddenly one day, a stranger started in to sing, he said, "I'm the dirty rascal and I'm here to teach the king!" and the queen clutched her jewels for she hated royal fools but this fool had some rules they really ought to teach in schools like you'll be a happy king if you enjoy the things you've got, you should never try to be the kind of person that you're not. So they sang and they laughed for the king had found a friend and they ran onto a rainbow for the story's perfect end, so the moral is you mustn't let the outside be the guide, for it's not so cut and dried, well, unless it's Dr. Jekyll then you better hide, petrified! No, the truth can't be denied as I now have testified, all that really counts and matters is the special stuff inside!
