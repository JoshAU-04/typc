Join in with me, with me. We'll fly on someone else's wings, to where everybody is one. Above the sky we read, it's written black on white - the truth, follow the lead. Echoes of the same old psalm. Sing with me, with me, in unity. Join in with me. I have been trying to break out for too long from the cage. I found my path when I thought that I was wrong. Stay close to me, to me. I'll show you what you need to see, to see.
