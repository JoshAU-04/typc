You can take my heart, you can take my breath. When you pry it from my cold, dead chest. This is how we rise up. Heavy as a hurricane, louder than a freight train. This is how we rise up. Heart is beating faster, feels like thunder. Magic, static, call me a fanatic. It's our world, they can never have it. This is how we rise up. It's our resistance, you can't resist us.
