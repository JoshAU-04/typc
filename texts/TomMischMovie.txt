My cheek brushes against his, smooth on stubble for a moment. And then it's gone. He walks along the platform as if in a dream, every fiber in me wants to shout and scream, "Stop!" To run across to him, take him in my arms, to tell him "I love you! You silly, silly man, I love you!" But instead I stand still, heart cracking. Those little curls on the back of his head bouncing, as he steps out of my life, forever.
