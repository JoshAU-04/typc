Alright, close your eyes. I want you to think of a flower. Look at its contours, its curves. Now I want you to imagine it: changing, moving backwards, returning to its bud. Think of that bud, unopened. Look at it, as a whole, and silently repeat these phrases: "May you be free from suffering. May you be free from fear. May you know peace and joy."
