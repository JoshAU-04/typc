Ah, the lengthening hours in the refinery, belching fire into the sky. We do our best vampire routines as we suck the dying hours dry. The night is lovely as a rose. If I saw sunlight hit you, I am sure that we'll both decompose. Ah, the fitful sleep and the fire engines that I dream of when I dream some day we'll both wake up for good. I will try hard not to scream. The evening winds will shake the blinds, you are stirring from your slumber. We've got something hateful on our minds.
