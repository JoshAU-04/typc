If depth of feeling is a currency then I'm the man who grew the money tree. Some of your friends are too brainy to see that they're paupers and that's how they'll stay. Well I don't know how many pounds make up a ton of all the Nobel prizes that I've never won and I may be the Mayor of Simpleton, but I know one thing, and that's I love you.
