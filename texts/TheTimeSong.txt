Time is a tool you can put on the wall or wear it on your wrist. The past is far behind us, the future doesn't exist. Time is a ruler to measure the day, it doesn't go backwards, only one way. Time went new and got old like history. Stuff from the past went into a mystery. It's out of my hands, I'm only a clock. Don't worry, I'm sure you'll be fine, but eventually everyone runs out of time.
