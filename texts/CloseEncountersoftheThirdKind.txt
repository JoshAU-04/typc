Ladies and gentlemen, this is a flying saucer. It's made of pewter, made in Japan, and thrown across the lawn by one of my children. I just wanted to point that out to you to show that we're not all polished brass about these things. Also to make a point that last year Americans shot more than seven billion photographs at a record of 6.6 billion dollars for film, equipment, and processing. Now with all those shutters clicking where is the indisputable photographic evidence?
