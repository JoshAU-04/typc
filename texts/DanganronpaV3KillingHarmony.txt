If you can't focus at all, it's also good to confine yourself somewhere and study! The thrill of studying in a place where you might get caught does wonders for your focus! Oh, and I also recommend studying in a disaster zone. The thrill of studying in a place where you could actually die does wonders for your focus! Oh, and I also recommend studying in the middle of your exams. The thrill of knowing it's too late to get any studying done does wonders for your focus!
