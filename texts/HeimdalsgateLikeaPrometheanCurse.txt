I'm in a crisis. I need help. Come on, mood, shift back to good again. Come on, be a friend. Nina Twin is trying to help, and I really hope that she succeeds. Though I picked the thorny path myself, I'm afraid of where it leads. Chemicals, don't strangle my pen. Chemicals, don't make me sick again. I'm always so dubious of your intent, like I can't afford to replace what you've spent. Come on, chemicals. Nina Twin is trying to help, and I really hope she gets me straight, because my own inner cosmology has become too dense to navigate.
