Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful. This means finding joy and fulfillment in our work and our passions, and pursuing them with dedication and enthusiasm. It means recognizing that success is not just about wealth or status, but about living a life that is meaningful and rewarding on a personal level.
