When my grandfather died, I was ten, and nobody had ever died on me before. All of a sudden, it hit me: I'm never going to see him again, but I was wrong. Every once in a while I'll get into a car that has that same stale, smoky scent, and it all comes back to me. I look forward to those flashbacks of him, and I wonder what, if anything, will remind people of me.
