I been doin' this a long time. I ain't never said nothin' to no cop. I feel old... I been out there since I was 13. I ain't never screwed up a count, never stole off a package, never did some stuff that I wasn't told to do. I've been straight up. But what come back? You think if I get jammed up on some stuff, they be like, "All right, yeah. Bodie been there. Bodie hang tough. We got to pay his lawyer. We got a bail." They want me to stand with them, right? Where they at when they supposed to be standing by us? I mean, when it goes bad and there's hell to pay, where they at? This game is rigged, man...
