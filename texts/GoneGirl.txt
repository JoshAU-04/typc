We were happy pretending to be other people. We were the happiest couple we knew. And what's the point of being together if you're not the happiest? But Nick got lazy. He became someone I did not agree to marry. He actually expected me to love him unconditionally. Then, he dragged me, penniless, to the navel of this great country, and found himself a newer, younger, bouncier "cool girl".
