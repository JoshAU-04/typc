May I say, before you go: I think perhaps you are one of the most powerful mages that I've ever had the pleasure to be in the presence of. And for this, I would offer a gift. I think it has been a long time since anyone has pointed out to you that you are a fool. Pain doesn't make people, it's love that makes people. The pain is inconsequential, it's love that saves them. And you would know that but you have none around you, you said so yourself. You surround yourself with lies and deceptions and... I wish for you, in the future, to find someone who will mourn you when you are gone. Respectfully.
