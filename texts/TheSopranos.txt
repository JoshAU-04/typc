That's too bad, I said lunch meet. You want a drink? Lose the glasses. I'm gonna say a few things. I'm gonna say some bad words. You're just gonna have to deal with it. Now, I know what you're thinking: you're thinking I clipped your uncle. On the one hand, you'd be an idiot to believe me when I told you I didn't do it. But I didn't. Now, I got some bad news for you. Look at me. Look at me. Your uncle was a rat.
