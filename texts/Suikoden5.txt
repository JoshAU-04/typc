I don't recall saying anything about justice. Mathias and I are evil, too, after all. A knight doesn't bring justice, just more pain and violence. And what is evil if not violence? But what do you do when leaving evil alive leads to the rise of even greater evil? Even worse sorrow and pain? You destroy that evil, even if you have to use the evil of violence to do so. And every time you draw your sword, you hope that you take from this world more evil than you bring into it. THAT is the code of the Maximillian Knights. I'm putting you on notice. You, who so carelessly use the word "justice", have no idea what it truly means. Though you strike me as more of a misguided coward than a villain, your evil deeds must still be punished.
