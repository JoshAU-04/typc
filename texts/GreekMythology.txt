Their names were Clotho (Spinner), Lachesis (Allotter), and Atropos (Inflexible). Clotho spun the thread of human fate, Lachesis dispensed it, and Atropos cut the thread (thus determining the individual's moment of death). The Romans identified the Parcae, originally personifications of childbirth, with the three Greek Fates. The Roman goddesses were named Noma, Decuma, and Morta.
