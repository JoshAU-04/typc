How am I supposed to decide this? How can I possibly stay without Mom and Dad? This is too much. I don't even understand how it all works, why I'm here in the state that I'm in or how to get out of it if I wanted to. If I were to say, "I want to wake up," would I wake up right now? I've already tried snapping my heels to find Teddy and tried to beam myself to Hawaii, and that didn't work. This seems a whole lot more complicated.
