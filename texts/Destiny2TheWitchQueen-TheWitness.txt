We have seen enough. The children of Sol cry out for salvation. You promised them life... but deliver only death. As you have for so many before. Enough. Enough death. Enough life. You have no pieces left to place. The game is over. Do not be afraid. Your pale heart holds the key. This time... there is no escape.
