As I suspected, the dining car of the Molentary Express is quite popular with the passengers, and though we've waited patiently to be seated, I get the feeling we won't be eating any time soon. The waiter recommended waiting for the lunchtime rush to pass on the observation deck located in the last carriage. I'm inclined to take his advice.
