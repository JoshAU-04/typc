Sometimes I just stare at myself in the bathroom mirror. I mean, not just for a minute or two, but for a really, really long time. That's a bit weird, isn't it? I just stand there with the door locked. I stand there and stare and wonder. I look deep into my eyes, almost like I'm looking for something. I look at my nose, my ears, my mouth, the shape of my head. I'm searching for something. Something I don't understand. It's like this person I'm looking at isn't really me. When I sleep and I dream, I'm not this person looking back at me.
