Look, I know you doubt me. I know - I know you always have. And you're right, I often think of Bag-End. I miss my books, and my armchair, and my garden. See, that's where I belong. That's home. And that's why I came back. Because... you don't have one. A home. It was taken from you. But I will help you take it back if I can.
