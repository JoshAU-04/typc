Stop! Enough! I have heard more than enough to render my judgment. For as long as I have known you, Holger, you have spun words into lies. You weaken the minds of children, and delude the minds of men. I've shown you too many years of tolerance. And rather than exist in grateful meekness, as Holger the liar, you sink lower. You become Holger the Thief, robbing a woman of her livelihood, all in the name of your stupid stories!
