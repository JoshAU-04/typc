The best way to predict your future is to create it. This means taking control of our lives and our destinies, and actively shaping the course of our future. It means setting goals and working towards them with determination and persistence, even when the path is difficult or uncertain. It means being willing to take risks and try new things, and never giving up in the face of adversity or setbacks.
