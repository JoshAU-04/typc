Jonathan, you have touched my very being. I shall remember you. You taught all that knew you what courage meant and have shown us an example in death as you did in life. God give me strength in my life without you. And I shall thank her. I can only hope that our souls shall entwine again in the place where there is only love, no tears, no sadness, no injustice, no cruelty, no white, no black, no zombies, no hate, no war, only love. Only love, Alison.
