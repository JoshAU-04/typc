Dear Me 10 Years from now, If you still feel the need to listen to this again, then maybe something went wrong? Or did you change? Do you remember? What happened? Is life better, or worse? It's never too late to try and fix things. Right now, you're probably wondering how I felt when you wrote this. Well, right now, I guess I feel like I don't have a lot of control of my life, but it's exciting nonetheless. I'm smart and handsome, and I have goals to work toward. So... me in 10 years from now, if you're reading this and you feel like things haven't changed, then just remember that it's never too late. The world around you must be different by now, but it doesn't mean you have to be. Stay positive, and keep doing your best.
