Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in. Maybe that's a problem, 'cause I've been dealing with it ever since. I thought that it would leave, but it's obvious, it never did. It must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in. Now I'm in the position, it's either sit here and let him win or put it back outside where it came from, but I never can. 'Cause in order to do that I would have to open the doors. Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore.
