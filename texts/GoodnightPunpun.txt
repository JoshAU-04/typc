People are free. Well they can't fly on their own, but pretty much whatever they can think up, they can make happen. When they're sleepy, they can sleep. They're free to start or quit whatever they're doing whenever they want. And the only reason they don't is because things like social norms, laws, traditions and sentiment get in the way. Running naked through the street, conning old people, killing. Everything's possible if you ignore morality. That's why they insist on teaching you cooperation and ethics when you're young. But the world is set up to force people to fight, cheat and steal as a default. Trying to live with that contradiction is torture. But in so many places, happiness and sorrow are traded like stocks on Wall Street. What will it take for everyone to be happy? Who knows? But if a kid could figure it out, war would've gone extinct a long time ago.
