You ruined me. You left me to suffer at the hands of a father who valued only strength. You lied to me, to hide your own transgressions because of your own fear! My whole life I sought the approval I was denied by the man I thought was my father. You turned me into the weakling he hated!... Look at me! You rant and you rage about the monster I have become, but you mother, you are the author of everything I am.
