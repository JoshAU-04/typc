Our on demand culture is fueling entitlement. From drone delivery to overnight six-pack abs, we want what we want and we want it now. Lost is an appreciation for craft. For hard work. For the long haul. But that journey - and all the obstacles, struggle and setbacks that come with it - shouldn't be avoided. And it shouldn't just be tolerated. It should be welcomed with all the enthusiasm you can muster. Because love of process is everything. Without it, you simply will not reach your potential. Period.
