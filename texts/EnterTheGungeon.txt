Throughout the galaxy a legend is told, on a distant planet a grim fortress stood, until a deadly force parted the heavens and descended upon the keep. Though brought to ruin, the ashes of that place hold an artifact of impossible power - a gun that can kill the past. Over time the fortress was rebuilt, and some who hear the legend would risk everything for another shot - to claim their prize and make what was done, undone they must - Enter The Gungeon.
