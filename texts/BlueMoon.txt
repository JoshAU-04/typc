Blue moon, you saw me standing alone, without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own. Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for, you heard me saying a prayer for, someone I really could care for. And then there suddenly appeared before me, the only one my arms will ever hold. I heard somebody whisper "please adore me," and when I looked the moon had turned to gold.
