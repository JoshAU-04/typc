I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me so right. And how you held me in your arms that September night, the first time you ever saw me cry. Maybe this is wishful thinking, probably mindless dreaming. And if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right. I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't.
