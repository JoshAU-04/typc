Some forms of high-tech communication can hinder concentration on other tasks. Experts who study human-machine interactions - things like instant messaging, calendar reminders, e-mail alerts, and computer pop-ups - report that the wired world suffers from "distraction overload and continuous partial attention." The result of a succession of interruptions may be that "you risk never focusing exclusively on any thought or perception for long and never being able to work straight through to completion on anything." Among other things, such distractions can cause memory loss and decreased memory accuracy as well as potentially disastrous errors.
