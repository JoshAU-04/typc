Picture this. Two young girls, best friends, who share three things: a pizza recipe, some dough and a dream. Everything is going great, until one day, a fast-talking pepperoni salesman gallops into town. Of course, both girls are impressed. He dates one one night, and the other the next night. Pretty soon, he drives a wedge between them. Before you know it, the pizza suffers, the business suffers, the friendship suffers. The girls part company and head for America, never to see one another again. Rose, one of those girls was me. The other one, you probably know as Mama Celeste.
