So I go about my day as normal. But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event. It consumes me. I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off. And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became. And I don't know if I can go on the same. But I don't wanna dig up old bones. I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number. Who knows? Maybe she does.
