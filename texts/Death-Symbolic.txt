I don't mean to dwell, but I can't help myself. When I feel the vibe and taste a memory of a time in life, when years seemed to stand still. I close my eyes and sink within myself. Relive the gift of precious memories, in need of a fix called innocence. When did it begin, the change to come was undetectable. The open wounds expose the importance of our innocence, a high that can never be bought or sold.
