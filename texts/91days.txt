What about you? Why are you still alive? You wanted revenge against the Vanettis, right? And you finished that crap already, right? Hey, you listening to me? He never wanted to join the Family. Even when I told him how rich he could get, he wouldn't even think about it. It was stupid how damn straight-laced he was. But you... You drove him crazy. And you killed him. He'd never even been with a woman... How is it right that you live and he dies!? Hey, are you listening!?
