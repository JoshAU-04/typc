You see, boys forget what their country means by just reading 'the land of the free' in history books. And they get to be men - they forget even more. Liberty's too precious a thing to be buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men should hold it up in front of them every single day of their lives and say: "I'm free to think and to speak. My ancestors couldn't, I can, and my children will." Boys ought to grow up remembering that.
