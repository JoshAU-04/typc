Well, Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene. He goes to the reservation, he drinks and gets mean, and he's gonna start a war. He hops in his pickup, puts the pedal to the floor, and says "I got mine, but I want more." Because Cowboy Dan's a major player in the cowboy scene. He goes to the desert, fires his rifle in the sky, and says "God, if I have to die, you will have to die."
