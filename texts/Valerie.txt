It can't be, somebody tell me this is all a dream. Left your rings, like the life we had didn't mean a thing... can't you see you've broken me? Oh Valerie, this isn't how our story had to be. Oh Valerie, thought you'd always be a part of me. I don't know if you know, I still think about you, oh... if you're ever coming home - I miss you so.
