Well, if it isn't the man of the hour... You're late. I've been waiting for you FOREVER, mister! I was beginning to think you'd stood me up. I thought to myself, "Wendy, is Mario ever going to show up?" And then I dozed off. Anyway, Mr. Bowser sent me to stop you from getting your grubby little mitts on this Big Paint Star. And now that I've gotten some peaceful rest, it's time to help you rest in peace!
