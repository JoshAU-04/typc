I had this very faith tested on an ordinary day: I was walkin' down a busy street around my way. I saw a face in the crowd that made my heart skip a beat - A man who looked exactly like an older version of me! So I moved through the hustle and the bustle of the day to day until me and this man stood face to face. We locked eyes and for a moment time moved in slow motion as the crowd around continued on their paper chase. I stood frozen in disbelief and opened my mouth to speak but to my surprise the words wouldn't come. And then he looks into a clear blue sky up above and says "it's gonna rain" - and then it does! And as the rain came down like missiles from the sky set on a collision course from the heavens to the ground, he's just standin' in the middle of it all unconcerned by the panic and the people runnin' round. So I stepped to this man with my hand outstretched just to offer him some help to get the storm up off his head. He took my hand down and we stood gettin' drenched. He looked me in the eyes and with a smile, this is what he said: Hush child, from the joy to the pain it'll all wash away in the rain. Hush child, from the joy to the pain it'll all wash away in the rain.
