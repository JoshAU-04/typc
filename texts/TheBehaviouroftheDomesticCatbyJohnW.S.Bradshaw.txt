The behaviour of the domestic cat, Felis silvestris catus, has many features that set it apart from other common domestic animals, even its fellow carnivore the dog. Cats seem to have effected a unique and successful compromise between reliance on man and the retention of behaviour patterns that permit an independent existence. During the first decade of the 21st century the cat has become the preferred pet of many owners, valued because it combines an affectionate nature with a degree of independence, as well as more prosaic qualities such as cleanliness and convenience.
