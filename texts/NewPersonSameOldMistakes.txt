I can just hear them now. "How could you let us down?" But they don't know what I felt, or see it from this way around. Feeling it overtake, all that I used to hate. Wonder what if we trade. I tried but it's way too late. All the slides I don't read, two sides of me can't agree. When I breathe in too deep. Going with what I always longed for.
