They'll kiss you in the evening - devils in disguise - and love you 'til the morning, then vanish before your eyes. A walking disaster can also master a graceful posture, but where's the dignity? When? I wish I had a lover who'd keep it undercover. We could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings. I wish I had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother to tell me what to feel, to tell me what is real.
