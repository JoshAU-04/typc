You wanna know what was done? A fundraising campaign to help you while you were on the street. I warned you to go back out onto the water so that the Snells wouldn't come after you - in fact, I begged them to let you go back down onto the water, instead of them just killing you and Grace, right then and there. And when they didn't listen to me, I paid seven hundred thousand dollars to save your lives. Seven hundred thousand dollars! Every single thing I've done has been to help you. Everything I've told you to do has been to help you, and what have you done? You've done the exact opposite every single time, and what did it get you? It got you right here.
