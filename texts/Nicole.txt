It's hard to believe when your mind is lost and in need, and all you can picture is a memory inside of someone else's sheets. A prayer that nothing will keep; a hope that light will seek before the dark sinks too deep, or at least the sinking feeling inside of me will decrease when the release of perceived dreams burn in the flame of feeling free.
