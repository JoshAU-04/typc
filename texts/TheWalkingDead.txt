What happened Rick? I thought you weren't the good guy anymore, ain't that what you said? Even right here right now you ain't gonna fight for 'em? I'm a better father than you, Rick. I'm better for Lori than you, man. It's 'cause I'm a better man than you, Rick. 'Cause I can be here and I'll fight for it. But you come back here and you just destroy everything!
