Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried. It was all part of the story, even the scary nights. Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered. Thank you to all of the heroes of the night. They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off. Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off.
