Unfortunately, my birthday has always been the lousiest day of the year. It all began on the day of my actual birth... both of my parents failed to show up. By the age of 5, I was forced to throw my own surprise party at Gunther Goat Cheese's: the goat-cheesiest place in all of Drusselstein. Many of my closest friends were there: Count Wolfgang, Betty the She-Boar, Ratputin, and the licekins, Olga and Chicago Joe. But one should never walk the paths of Drusselstein with uncovered doonkleberry cake, lest the doonkleberry bats swarm.
