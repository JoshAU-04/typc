I conducted a personal interview with her to discover why she was in such a foul mood. "What? You want to know why I'm in a bad mood even with this party going on? It's because it's a party. Everyone makes a huge mess, then they go home when they're all tired out without even thinking of helping to clean up. Or are you saying that you do?" I didn't want to help so I just poured her some sake from a nearby bottle and her mood instantly improved. It appears that she does not dislike drinking.
