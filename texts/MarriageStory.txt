What I love about Charlie: Charlie is undaunted. He never lets other people's opinions, or any setbacks keep him from what he wants to do. Charlie eats like he's trying to get it over with, and like there won't be enough food for everyone. A sandwich is to be strangled while devoured. But he's incredibly neat, and I rely on him to keep things in order. He's energy-conscious. He doesn't look in the mirror too often.
