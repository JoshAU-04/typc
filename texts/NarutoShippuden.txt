The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace, initiates wars. And hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated. I want to sever the fate of this world. A world of only victors. A world of only peace. A world of only love. I will create such a world. I am... the ghost of the Uchiha.
