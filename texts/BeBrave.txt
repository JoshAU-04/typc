Wildflower knew I wasn't well, but on the kitchen floor I got better again. I grabbed my keys and drove toward a star, and there I was understood for the first time in my life, 'cause that's when I was introduced to true serendipity. I knew it when you showed up again in the snow, I was always told your heart is where you're home.
