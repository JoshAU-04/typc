Meaningless, huh? What do you know of meaningless? Spend most of your life ruled by another! Watch your race dwindle to a handful! And then, tell me what has more meaning than your own strength! I have in me the blood of a Saiyan prince. He is nothing but a joke! Yet, I've had to watch him surpass me in strength, my destiny thrown to the wayside! He's... he's even saved my life like I were a helpless child. He has stolen my honor, and his debts... must be paid!
