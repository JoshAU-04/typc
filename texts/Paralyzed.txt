I'm in the race of life and time passed by. I sit back and I watch it, hands in my pockets. Waves come crashing over me, but I just watch 'em. I just watch 'em. I'm underwater, but I feel like I'm on top of it. I'm at the bottom, but I don't know what the problem is. I'm in a box, but I'm the one who locked me in. I'm suffocating and I'm running out of oxygen.
