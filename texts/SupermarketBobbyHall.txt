My point is that you asked how and I am giving you the examples, the possibilities, because when I want something, truly want something that my life depends on - which is purpose and happiness - I will stop at nothing to attain. It's like breathing. So you must ask yourself: What is your air? What is the thing you literally will fight for to survive?
