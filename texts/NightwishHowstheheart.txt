Sorrow hides well in your shell. A fellow man with hurt to spare. Dear one, here I am to share the fear. An act of kindness, without an amen. How's the heart, underneath the silence? How's the heart, drowning in the mire? Let us sound a human paean. Come in, the fire's warm. Burn the rope and dance some more.
