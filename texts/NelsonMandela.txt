The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. This means recognizing that failure and setbacks are a natural part of the journey to success, and using them as opportunities to learn and grow. It means finding the strength and resilience to get back up and keep going, even when things seem impossible. It means believing in ourselves and our abilities, and never giving up on our dreams.
