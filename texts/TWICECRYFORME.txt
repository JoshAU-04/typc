I want you to cry, cry for me. The way I cried for you baby, cry for me. Make your rain fall cry for me, but again, somehow you keep me goin' round and round. All the walls I built around me come crashing down. Making excuses gotta drown them out. I want you to, I want you to, I want you to cry for me.
