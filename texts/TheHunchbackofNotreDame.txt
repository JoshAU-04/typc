What have you done? You have awakened in me all that should have stayed dormant. I have sought a tranquil existence, and had it, until I saw you. Since then my powers have failed me, for I cannot rid myself of you. In every book I read, I see your face. In every sound, I hear your voice, or the jingle of your tambourine. I've questioned my conscience through the deep hours of the night only to awaken in greater confusion.
