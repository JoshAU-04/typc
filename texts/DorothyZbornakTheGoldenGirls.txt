The most romantic thing was when Stan proposed. I went to the powder room, and when I returned to the table, there was an open bottle of Dom Perignon and two filled glasses. We clinked the glasses in a toast and Stan gave me a coy smile, and I winked at him and I just downed the champagne in one gulp. And it didn't go down smoothly. Later, Stan told me that he put my engagement ring in the bottom of the glass.
