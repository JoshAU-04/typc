A Yoga master came to my office for a consult. I asked her to show me what made her pain worse. She sat on the floor in a pose fully twisting her spine, staying there for several minutes. It took her another few minutes to work through the pain to stand up. I stated, "I think I know what is causing your pain - doing that exercise."
