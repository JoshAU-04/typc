In the town where I live there's just a tiny beach that's never busy, not even in the middle of summer. I used to like walking there, looking for stuff. Like old fireworks. Or kelp. A hat knocked off someone's head by the wind. You basically never find what you were expecting to. And maybe you weren't expecting to find anything right from the start. Yeah that's probably the truth. And if you're not expecting anything, you won't be disappointed either. So don't get your hopes way up about me, Otsu. It'll just make me feel pressured, like I might let you down one day.
