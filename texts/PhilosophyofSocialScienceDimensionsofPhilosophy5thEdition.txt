Though the sciences cannot answer philosophical questions, individual scientists have to take sides on the right answers to them. The positions scientists take on answers to philosophical questions determine the questions they consider answerable by science and choose to address, as well as the methods they employ to answer them. Sometimes scientists take sides consciously. More often they take sides on philosophical questions by their very choice of question, and without realizing it.
