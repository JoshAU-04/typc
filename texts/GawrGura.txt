I don't know, maybe it's not great progress compared to other people, but I'm happy with my progress. And you know what? Quite frankly, that's all that matters. If you spend too much time worrying about, you know, other people's progress and how it matches up to yours then... I don't know, you might forget what really matters, and that's your progress, you know?
