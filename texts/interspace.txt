There is another self, more really "us" than "I". And if you become aware of that unknown self - the more you become aware of it - the more you realize that it is inseparably connected with everything there is. That you are a function of this total galaxy, bounded by the Milky Way, and that furthermore this galaxy is a function of all other galaxies. And that vast thing that you see far off, far off, far off with telescopes, you look, and look, and look. One day you'll go and wake up and say, "Why, that's me!" And in knowing that now, you see that you'll never die.
