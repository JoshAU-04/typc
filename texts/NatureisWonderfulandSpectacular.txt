Lush green hills and plains, forests that are filled with rain, canyons that are rusty red, grasslands are as soft as beds. Flashing lightning in the sky, birds do fly so high, lovely breeze makes its way through the trees. A gleaming ocean in daylight, moths flutter throughout the night, colorful birds fly in the sky, clouds in the sunset soar so high. An illuminating sunrise lights the sky to show that Earth will hold us each day that goes by.
