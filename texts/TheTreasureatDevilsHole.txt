My older brother, Tom, had spent the last month digging in the cornfield. Ever since turning 17 he had an urge to dig. Nobody knew why he was digging - he just was. When anyone asked him why, he would only say, "I'm digging for Mom." I didn't know how digging a hole was good for Mom, and didn't question it. If he wanted to get in trouble with her, that was up to him.
