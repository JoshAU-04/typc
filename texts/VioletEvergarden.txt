Spring, summer, autumn, and winter... Many seasons have come and gone, but the one with you isn't coming around at all. At first, I couldn't understand. I couldn't understand anything about how you felt. But within this new life you gave me, I've begun to feel the same way as you, if only a little, through ghostwriting, and through the people I've met along the way. I believe that you are still alive somewhere. So, I shall live, live, live, and live some more, though there's no telling what life might have in store. And if I can see you again, I want to let you know... that the phrase "I love you"... I understand it a little now.
