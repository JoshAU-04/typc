When we doubt our hearts, our bodies react. Tear ducts overflow and the face flushes red hot embers. A burning, turning sensation overwhelms, and a pressure in the head seduces the mind to doubt. A cycle of connection, a circle of ever-expanding, inexplicable nervous system responses. When we doubt our heads, our stomach cramps, our fists clench and our thoughts tumble into larger and larger whirls of uncertainty, beating our bodies blue and scabish. When we quiet our minds and center our soul we are receptive to an intuition much stronger than knowledge and knowing.
