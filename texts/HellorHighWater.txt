You know. I've been working here for 44 years. Ain't nobody ever ordered nothing but T-Bone steak and a baked potato. Except this one dude from New York tried to order trout back in 1987. We don't sell no goddamned trout. T-Bone steaks. So either you don't want the corn on the cob, or you don't want the green beans. So what don't you want?
