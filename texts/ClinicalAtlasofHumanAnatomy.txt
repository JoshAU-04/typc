The bony attachments of the buccinator muscle are to the upper and lower jaws (maxilla and mandible) opposite the three molar teeth. The upper attachment of temporalis occupies the temporal fossa (the narrow space above the zygomatic arch at the side of the skull). The lower attachment of temporalis extends from the lowest part of the mandibular notch of the mandible, over the coronoid process and down the front of the ramus almost as far as the last molar tooth. Masseter extends from the zygomatic arch to the lateral side of the ramus of the mandible.
